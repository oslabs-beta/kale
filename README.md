## Features

- üìä **Real-time GPU Monitoring**: Get live updates on utilization, temperature, power draw, and other essential GPU metrics with kale.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Metric Snapshots**: kale captures historical data points beyond real-time monitoring. These snapshots allow for in-depth analysis and performance optimization over time.
- üß† **Smart Scaling**: Optimize resource allocation for machine learning workloads with GPU-driven HPA configuration.

## Getting Started

The simplest and most efficient way to dive into kale is through [our official hosted service](https://).

### Prerequisites

Here's what you need to be able to run kale:

- GPU-enabled Kubernetes cluster
- Prometheus server integrated with cluster
- NVIDIA DCGM-exporter deployed in cluster

## Demo

1. üìù Sign up for kale.

## Run kale locally

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: You won't be able to save snapshots if you run kale locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oslabs-beta/kale.git
cd kale
```

### 2. Install npm dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### 3. Run the dev server

```shell
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open the app in your browser

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Beta Limitations and Exciting Future

CPU-Based Proof of Concept: Currently, kale uses CPU metrics as a proxy for GPU utilization. This provides a valuable proof of concept.

**Roadmap: We envision exciting features including:**

- **GPU Metric Integration**: Replace CPU monitoring with direct GPU metric monitoring for enhanced scaling accuracy tailored to ML workloads.
- **Multi-Pod Monitoring**: Monitor resource consumption trends across multiple pods.
- **Snapshot Customization**: Allow users to rename snapshots for better organization.
- **Autoscaling Integration**: Directly trigger Kubernetes cluster scaling actions based on in-app analysis.
